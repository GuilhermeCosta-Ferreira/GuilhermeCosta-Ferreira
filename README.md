## Hi there 👋

🙋 My name is Guilherme Costa Ferreira, and I'm an MSc Neuro-X student from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) with a BSc in Biomedical Engineering degree from Instituto Superior Técnico (IST). One of my areas of interest is the brain and the use of technologies related to it, more precisely, brain-machine interfaces. How can we decode the information from the neural activity into meaningful and applicable intel?

✅ I have participated in many events, workshops, lectures, associations, and volunteer activities during these years. Besides that, I also ride horses, making dressage one of my favorite hobbies. 

👨‍💻 I have also built some cool software that you can find here! If you want to have a good overview of my professional and personal projects, feel free to check my portfolio!

🦅 I aim to be a complete person who can excel at his job, working well in a team and producing more for society.
